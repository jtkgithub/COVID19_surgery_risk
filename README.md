# COVID19_surgery_risk
This repository contains R code for a modelling study of the risks related to doing surgery on asymptomatic COVID19 patients.

The work is documented in the manuscript "Estimating risk of admitting patients with presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 to surgery during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and perioperative pulmonary complications and mortality" and the supplementary material for the manuscript.


The code in the file "contour_curves.R" generate plot 1 and 2 in the manuscript.

The code in the file "sim_model_contrywise_plots.R" generate plot 3 in the manuscript and similar plots for other countries and surgery rates.

The code in the file "combined_cumulative_plots_ggplot.R" generate plot 4 in the manuscript.
